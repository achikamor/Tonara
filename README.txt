Some explanations about my program:

1) when an admin teacher is trying to update/delete teacher from another school, he will be redirect to a landing page
that contain a <h1> tag who says "you are not allowed to ... teacher from another school".

2) same happens when a school is trying to delete teacher from another school.

3) I added the option for school to see all its teachers

4) I used one application only (even though it's much more organized to use multiple application, since you said this
project should be a "production level code" I tried to minimize it as much as I can).

5) appearance: I know this site doesn't have the best appearance, but I tried to write this project as fast as I can
and the appearance seems to be less important than the implementation of Django usage

6) Extra points: I hope I had more time to accomplish all those points but it's been a week since you first sent my
this assignment and I afraid that you'll move forward with other candidates.


Few personal word:
Dear Or, first thank you very much for the opportunity to show you my learning and implementation skills, in the past
week I learned what is Django and how to use it (as I said in the interview I never used Django).
To be completely honest, it took my more than 6 hours (most of the time spent on learning Django)
but today I know that a similar project using Django framework will take me about 6 hours.
Even though it was very intense (as I said I tried to complete it as fast as I can), I enjoyed very much, so again,
thank you!

Hope to hear from you again, Achikam Mor.
